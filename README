ABOUT
=====

Modifies a CentOS 7.2+ x86_64 DVD with a kickstart that will install a system 
that is configured and hardened to meet government regluations.

The kickstart script involves the integration of the following projects 
into a single installer:

   - classification-banner.py (Python for displaying a graphical classification banner)
   
        https://github.com/RedHatGov/classification-banner
        
   - SCAP Security Guide (SSG) - Hardening Script for CentOS7
   
        https://github.com/openscap/scap-security-guide

HARDENING INFORMATION
=====================

Here is some additional information added by the supplemental hardening script
in addition to the SSG:

1. The kernel option for  FIPS 140-2 mode is contained on the kickstart menu

2. Shell timeout (bash/csh) is 15 minutes of inactivity, vlock will lock CLI
   console

3. The 'wheel' group is required for privileged users (beyond root) to run 
   `su -` or `sudo -i` commands, sudo timeout is 5 minutes

4. The 'sshusers' group is required for SSH/SFTP access, other users are 
   limited to console access without this group
   
5. Additional Software such as McAfee EPo/HBSS may be required meet site 
   policy

6. Configure NTP (/etc/chrony.conf) and rsyslog logging to remote server 
   (/etc/rsyslog.conf)

8. Create users:

        Local Console Access Only (Unprivileged)
          
               # useradd -m -c "Local User" localuser
               
        Remote Access (Unprivileged)
          
               # useradd -m -c "Remote User" -G sshusers remoteuser
               
        System Administrator (SA) (Privileged User)
               
               # useradd -m -c "System Administrator" -G sshusers,wheel admin
               
        (Optional) After adding SAs to the system, lock the root account:
          
               # passwd -l root

9. Wireless  is disabled in a number of ways with Network Manager including:

	a.) `nmcli radio all off` command in /etc/rc.local
	b.) Dconf configurations to disable the creation of wireless networks:
	
		/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/99-gnome-hardening
			[org.gnome.nm-applet]
			disable-wifi-create=true

		/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/locks/99-gnome-hardening
			/org/gnome/nm-applet/disable-wifi-create
	
		/usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/99_custom_settings.gschema.override
			[org.gnome.nm-applet]
			disable-wifi-create=true

   Generally, wireless should not be used on a DoD/IC system.
